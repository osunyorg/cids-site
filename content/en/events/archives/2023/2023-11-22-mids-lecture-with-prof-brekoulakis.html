        <p>The MIDS is delighted to welcome you to the Lecture on "Impartiality and the Construction of Trust in Investor State Dispute Settlement" with Prof. Stavros Brekoulakis.</p><p>Drawing on the findings of a large-scale empirical project, the lecture questions the applicability of an orthodox judicial doctrine of impartiality to ISDS on the grounds that trust in arbitrators is constructed on a fundamentally different basis from that of trust in judges. The Lecture calls for a new, and contextualised, approach which better corresponds to the fundamental value of trust in ISDS.</p><p><strong>Location</strong></p><p>Uni-Mail MS 160<br>University of Geneva<br>Bd du Pont-d'Arve 40<br>1205, Geneva</p><p><b>Speakers</b></p><ul><a href="https://www.cids.ch/mids/the-program/the-faculty/595-stavros-brekoulakis"></a></ul><p> <img>Stavros Brekoulakis, <a href="https://www.cids.ch/mids/the-program/the-faculty/595-stavros-brekoulakis" target="_blank">https://www.cids.ch/mids/the-program/the-faculty/595-stavros-brekoulakis</a>Faculty</p><p>Professor</p><ul><a href="https://www.cids.ch/mids/the-program/the-faculty/595-stavros-brekoulakis"></a></ul>
