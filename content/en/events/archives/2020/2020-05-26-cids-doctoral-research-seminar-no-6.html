  body: >-
    The Geneva Center for International Dispute Settlement (CIDS) is pleased to invite you to the sixth Doctoral Research Seminar. The CIDS is adapting to the current situation and has the pleasure to offer the next seminar online.The discussion will be led by Dr. Niccolo Ridi (Lecturer, University of Liverpool) on "Mapping the Usable Past in International Adjudication: Understanding Precedent through Theory and Network Science".The seminars are free of charge and are limited to 15 participants per session. To register, please write to info@cids.ch, including "CIDS Ph.D. Seminars Registration" and your name in the subject line of the email.The deadline for registration is 25 May 2020. Registered participants will receive the link to the online session 24 hours before the seminar. Two CIDS Doctoral Research Seminars will take place each semester. This series offers Ph.D. students a platform to discuss central questions relating to doctoral research in international law, under the guidance of senior researchers in the field.The Seminars aim to achieve stimulating and provocative exchanges, leading doctoral students to ask important questions concerning research and to arrive at their own conclusions. Through these interactions, emerging international law scholars are expected to increase their autonomy as researchers and approach the challenges of the Ph.D. in a spirit of innovation.Ph.D. students from the University of Geneva and the Graduate Institute have first priority, then Ph.D. students from other institutions, with first-come first-served order within each category.LocationOnline
