The program covers the different stages of an ICC arbitration procedure as well as general observations of its current developments.</p><p>The course program and schedule are available <a href="https://www.cids.ch/images/CIDS/Executive_Courses/CIDS_Executive_Course_-_ICC_arbitration_updates_Geneva_Sept_2019_Program.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br> <strong>Program Learning Outcomes </strong></p><p>More specifically, the program will help participants to:</p><ul> <li>Understand the specificities and potential pitfalls of recent, current and future developments in ICC arbitration</li> <li>Understand how to best advise a client in regard to these developments and to ICC arbitrations generally</li> <li>Learn practical tips and skills from leading practitioners</li> <li>Learn from leading practitioners of several generations</li> </ul><p><strong><br></strong><strong>Methodology</strong></p><p>The sessions allow open questions and discussions.
