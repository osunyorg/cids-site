    The MIDS and the MIDS Alumni Association are delighted to invite you to the MIDS 15th Anniversary and 3rd MAA Annual Conference, entitled “Back to the Future”. In the last 15 years alone, internal and external influences have triggered several pivotal changes in the law and practice of international dispute settlement, leading to the recalibration of existing practices and the creation of new ones. Those associated with the MIDS program have had a front-row seat to these developments. Given this, what better way to celebrate 15 years of the MIDS, than to come together and explore these trends?The full-day conference thus aims to bring together the faculty, alumni, students, friends of the MIDS and more to discuss and debate the past, present, and future of international dispute settlement. This is an excellent opportunity to reconnect with old friends, meet new ones, and expand your professional network. Who should attend?The conference is open to all alumni, students, faculty, and friends of the MIDS, private practice lawyers, senior general counsel, experts and those associated with international international dispute settlement and arbitration generally.The conference will be followed by a cocktail reception.  ProgramThe event will address the evolution and future of sunset clauses, artificial intelligence, sanctions, and the environmental impact of arbitrations. Attendees will also enjoy a dedicated moot-style panel, where the speakers will each present and argue in favor of a landmark decision of their choice, explaining why that decision has proven to be influential for the advancement of international dispute settlement. The tribunal deciding the matter will be composed of top-tier arbitrators Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, Prof. Zachary Douglas KC, and Prof. Eduardo Silva Romero.You can download the full program here.LocationAuditorium A1-BMaison de la PaixGeneva, Switzerland
