        <p>Is the perception of the correctness of a legal decision influenced by in-group identities and other social bonds? This project aims at understanding, through quantitative, statistical analysis, the extent to which social identity plays a role in lawyers reviewing and annulling other lawyers’ decisions, here in the specific context of investment arbitration: in an ICSID ad hoc annulment committee procedure, how influenced are the committee members, when having to decide whether to annul an investment arbitration award of an ICSID tribunal, by similar social traits and by prior social experiences?<br></p>
