    The International Judicial Function under Pressure: Do Courts and Tribunals Go Off the Rails?

  body: >-
    <p>  <br>As part of its research project <br>on  "The International Judicial Function under Pressure: Do Courts andTribunals Go Off the Rails?" , the CIDS will host a conference, <br>inviting scholars and early career researchers to join the CIDS researchers and <br>leaders of this project in examining international judicial function and their <br>ongoing findings. Participants <br>will present their research, focusing on topics relating to judicial restraint, <br>activism, overreach, reasoning, and proposed corrective measures. The <br>conference facilitates discussions that delve into correlations between <br>judicial practices and the growing opposition to international courts and <br>tribunals. With <br>the ever-evolving challenges in international dispute settlement, this event <br>serves as a unique platform to explore legal questions and engage with the <br>Project’s extensive data and research. The Conference will be structured around <br>four substantive panels where participants will be presenting their research:  <br>  Introduction <br>     –  Defining <br>     the International Judicial Function and its Contours    <br>  Judicial <br>     Function and State Consent –  Overreaching or Fulfilling the <br>     Mandate?   <br>  <br>  Judicial <br>     Function and Economy –  Too Much or Too Little?   <br>  <br>  Judicial <br>     Function and Standards of Review –  to Judge or not to Judge ?  <br>  Judicial <br>     Function and Encroachment –  Meddling in Someone Else’s <br>     Affair?  <br>  <br>  Concluding <br>     Remarks  <br>   Project Description: In <br>the ever-changing landscape of international law and dispute settlement, a <br>notable shift has been observed since the early twenty-first century, marked by <br>mounting challenges and backlash against international courts and tribunals. <br>While contemporary research aims to address backlash against international <br>courts and tribunals from a multidisciplinary perspective, thus unifying the <br>field by bringing legal scholars, sociologists and political scientists <br>together, the purpose of this research project is to ascertain, through mixed <br>methods relying on qualitative analysis, whether adjudicators share part of the <br>blame for the current socio-legal context. In particular, the research project <br>aims to determine whether correlations can be established between backlash and <br>the way the judicial function has been exercised. Our project aims to catalogue <br>criticisms of judicial overreach and corrective proposals, offering a unique <br>empirical analysis of these issues. The specific and practical aim of the <br>project is thus to fill a gap, one that requires answering a twofold question. <br>What are the boundaries of the international judicial function, and what <br>constitutes interference in the exercise of that function?
