biography: >-
  <p>Mr. Senogles has a broad accounting practice which started in 1989, and which over the most recent twenty years, has focussed mainly on international arbitration and litigation expert witness appointments.</p><p>Having been a VP and a Partner in American and Canadian firms respectively, at the start of 2018 he revived his family's firm "Senogles &amp; Co., Chartered Accountants" - which had been first established in North Wales in 1925 by Geoff's grandfather and later run by his father.  As a chartered accountant with an ICAEW practising certificate and over 35 years' experience, Geoff leads the Senogles &amp; Co. team of colleagues in Switzerland and UK to focus on clarity and straightforward advice.</p><p>Having testified around 60-70 times - and having worked on many hundreds of separate cases since 1995 - the firm's expert witness mandate focus has changed and now more and more it is dispute advisory, consulting and investigation work that is taken on.  In addition, Geoff sits on the decision-making Investment Committee of global litigation funder Omni Bridgeway and he advises an expert witness agency.  During 2024, he was appointed to the ICC Switzerland Commission on Arbitration and ADR and he has sat on the boards of many client companies over the years.</p><p>He is a Welsh chartered accountant; based near Geneva since 2000 when he began working on staff at the United Nations Compensation Commission. He has taught the "Financial Damages" workshops at MIDS since 2010. </p><p>More information on <a href="http://www.senogles.com/" target="_blank">www.senogles.com<span class="sr-only"> - external link</span></a>    </p><p><strong>Selected publications:</strong></p><p>"Business Interruption Claims.
