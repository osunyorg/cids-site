        <p>As we mark the 15th anniversary of the Master in International Dispute Settlement (MIDS) program, it is time to celebrate a journey of innovation, a journey of knowledge and of collaboration.</p><p>Established through the visionary collaboration of the University of Geneva Faculty of Law and the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, MIDS has evolved into a beacon of legal education renowned for its comprehensive approach to international dispute resolution. Their unwavering support and belief in the program's potential have been instrumental in shaping the journey we celebrate today. Their commitment has been a cornerstone of its success, fostering an environment where legal minds can thrive and grow.</p><p>Our journey has also been enriched by the invaluable contributions of various international organizations, arbitral institutions, law firms, and our generous sponsors who have offered scholarships and support. Their involvement has not only strengthened the MIDS program but also fortified our resolve to create a more just and equitable world.</p><p>The essence of the MIDS lies in its community - a vibrant, diverse, and ever-expanding global network. With over 530 alumni from more than 90 countries, MIDS has become a place where cultures, ideas and dreamsconnect.</p><p>The balanced representation of women and men in our alumni reflects our commitment to gender equality and empowerment. Emerging and developing countries form a significant part of our student body, bringing unique perspectives that enrich our learning environment. This diversity is mirrored in our faculty, whose members come from various corners of the globe, adding depth and breadth to our academic discourse.</p><p>As we look back on these 15 years, we also acknowledge that the MIDS program is a living, evolving entity. It adapts, grows, and transforms, mirroring the dynamism of international dispute resolution itself. This fluidity ensures that our curriculum remains relevant, rigorous, and responsive to the changing global landscape.</p><p>As we step into the future, let us continue to be united by the ideals of the MIDS. Our shared dream of a world governed by the rule of law, where international conflicts find peaceful resolution, remains as relevant today as it was 15 years ago. The MIDS community, with its global reach and diverse perspectives, is ideally positioned to drive this vision forward.</p><p>As we mark the 15th anniversary of the MIDS, let us celebrate our achievements, cherish our present endeavours, and eagerly look forward to the future successes that await us. United in our purpose and passion, we continue our journey towards excellence in international dispute settlement.</p><p><i>Professor L. Boisson de Chazournes<br>MIDS and CIDS Director<br>September 2023</i></p><p>→ <a href="https://heyzine.com/flip-book/0bc69d93c7.html" target="_blank">See the MIDS Digital Memory Book as online flip book <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a></p>
