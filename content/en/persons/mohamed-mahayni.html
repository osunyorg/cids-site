biography: >-
  <p>Mohamed Yahya Mahayni is a dual-qualified solicitor (England & Wales) and <i>avocat</i> (Paris Bar) specialising in international arbitration.</p><p>   </p><p>Dr. Mahayni previously practised international arbitration at White & Case in London and Paris as well as independently. Also, he played an instrumental role in establishing an LLM program in London.  He joined the MIDS as a lecturer and is already a valued member of our community.  </p><p>His PhD from the University of Paris I Panthéon-Sorbonne was on "The Ideology of Investment Treaty Arbitrators" (<i>Mention très honorable avec félicitations du jury et encouragement de publier </i>- summa cum laude equivalent). In his thesis, he uses the notion of ideology to deconstruct not only the tensions underlying international investment law but also those dividing the investment arbitration community. </p><p> </p><p>Dr. Mahayni oversees the day-to-day operations of the MIDS while continuing to contribute to teaching and career services.  His scholarly work spans a wide range of arbitration topics, and he brings a unique dimension to the program through his parallel career in film as an award-winning actor.</p><p><b>Nationalities</b></p><p>Canada<br>France<br>Syria</p><p><b>Working languages</b></p><p>Arabic<br>English<br>French<br>Spanish</p><p><b>Other languages</b></p><p>Italian</p><p><b>Location</b></p><p>Geneva, Switzerland</p><p><b>PhD</b></p><p>Yes</p><p><b>Areas of Expertise</b></p><p>Legal Theory<br>Investment Treaty Arbitration<br>International Commercial Arbitration</p><p><b>Bar information</b></p><p>England & Wales<br>France (Paris Bar)  (voluntary omission in September 2024)  </p>
