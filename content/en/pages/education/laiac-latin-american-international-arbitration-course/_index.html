        <p>LAIAC sought to address the increasing demand for specialized teaching in international commercial and investment arbitration in Latin America. Participants to the 2020 course acquire a general understanding of procedural and substantive matters in both commercial and investment arbitration. Its intense program was also designed for participants to acquire practical knowledge in specialized sectors of international arbitration.</p><p><br><strong>The 2020 LAIAC program consisted of a General Course, 8 Thematic Courses, and 4 lectures.</strong> The program was initially designed for 40 participants from Latin America; in its online version, LAIAC was attended by 166 participants over three continents . Classes were <strong>taught in English</strong>, with the exception of one lecture in Spanish.</p>
