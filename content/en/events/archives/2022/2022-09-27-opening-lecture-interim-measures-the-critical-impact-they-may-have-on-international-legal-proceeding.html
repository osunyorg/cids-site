        <p>The MIDS is delighted to welcome you to the lecture on "Interim measures: the critical impact they may have on International legal proceedings" with Isabelle Michou.</p><p>Interim measures raise similar issues despite the different dispute resolution processes. This Lecture will cover the range of objectives pursued by interim measures (preserve a party's rights, protect the integrity of the proceedings, prevent aggravation or extension of the dispute), compare the approaches taken by international tribunals, and discuss the practical impact that interim measures may have, if granted, on the outcome of the parties' dispute.</p><p> <br><strong>Isabelle Michou</strong></p><p>Partner, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan LLP</p><p>Isabelle Michou is a top-ranked international arbitration practitioner. She was selected as a 2019 Law360 MVP in the category of International Arbitration and won the Global Arbitration Review's Award of the "2018 Most Important Decision" for her victory in the ICSID arbitration in Up and CD Holding Internationale v. Hungary. She also sits regularly as an arbitrator under the ICC Arbitration Rules and other rules, including SCC, LCIA, and the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA)'s Optional Rules for Arbitration of Disputes Relating to Natural Resources and/or the Environment.</p><p>Isabelle teaches Advocacy in International Arbitration at Sciences Po of Paris and the Queen Mary University of London. She is on the Executive Committee of the Swiss-based Foundation for International Arbitration Advocacy (FIAA) and of the Swedish Arbitration Association (SAA), as well as a Member of the Board of the Comité Français d'Arbitrage (CFA).<br><br></p><p><b>Location</b></p><p>Uni-Mail M R070<br>University of Geneva<br>Bd du Pont-d'Arve 40<br>1205, Geneva</p>
