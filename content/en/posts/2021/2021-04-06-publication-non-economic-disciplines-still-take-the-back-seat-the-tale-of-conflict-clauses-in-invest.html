    <p>  <br>Dafina Atanasova, "Non-economic <br>disciplines still take the back seat: The tale of conflict clauses in <br>investment treaties", Leiden Journal of International Law, Volume 34(1), <br>155-180.The article is part of the Symposium on International Investment Law <br>and Human RightsAbstract:The article offers a <br>new perspective on the interaction of international investment law with other <br>fields of international law based on an empirical study of the use of conflict <br>clauses in over 1,000 investment treaties, providing a first systematic account <br>of this type of provision.The use and content of <br>conflict clauses serve as an indicator of state priorities regarding the <br>coordination of investment standards of protection with other disciplines in <br>the international law matrix. Both numerically and from qualitative <br>perspectives, the clauses’ survey reveals important asymmetries in the <br>engagement on the part of investment treaty makers with international economic <br>disciplines, as compared to non-economic disciplines and human rights more <br>specifically. Indeed, conflict clauses on international economic law are much <br>more common, more detailed and establish clearer priority rules than similar <br>provisions on any other field of international law; and the disparity is only <br>likely to deepen over time. This analysis suggests that negotiators already <br>have the toolkit to create effective links between international norms and <br>institutions, and it is only its use that is uneven.</p>  <p>As a result, the <br>article suggests a shift in policy perspective to reflect that reality. Such a <br>shift seems all the more relevant considering the growing body of literature <br>showing that investment arbitrators (and international adjudicators more <br>generally) pay only limited attention to norms from fields beyond their own, <br>thus casting doubt on their capacity to develop a principled approach on the <br>issue without treaty guidance.</p>  <p> Dafina Atanasova - Non-economic disciplines still take the back seat The tale of conflict clauses in investment treaties </p>
