biography: >-
  <p>Mohamed Yahya Mahayni is a dual-qualified solicitor (England &amp; Wales) and <i>avocat</i> (Paris Bar) specialising in international arbitration.</p><p>At the MIDS, Mohamed teaches international commercial arbitration, arbitration in England, arbitration in France, and state-to-state arbitration. His research crosscuts the theory and practice of international arbitration as a method of resolving contract and treaty disputes.</p><p>Mohamed holds a Ph.D. in International Law from Sorbonne Law School (University of Paris 1) (<i>Mention très honorable avec félicitations du jury et encouragement de publier </i>- summa cum laude equivalent). In his thesis, he uses the notion of ideology to deconstruct not only the tensions underlying international investment law but also those dividing the investment arbitration community.</p><p>Prior to joining the MIDS, Mohamed taught commercial and investment arbitration on Queen Mary University of London's Distance Learning LLM in International Dispute Resolution (2018-2024). He also acted in international arbitrations under institutional and ad hoc rules, both as counsel and secretary to tribunals (White &amp; Case LLP 2007-2013 and independently 2018-present).</p><p>              <b>Nationalities</b></p><p>Canada<br>France<br>Syria      </p>
