  <p>Dr Tariq Baloch is a barrister at 3 Verulam Buildings, one of England's leading chambers. He is one of a small group of five UK barristers aged under 45 recognised by Who's Who Legal as "the future leaders of the international arbitration community". In 2019 Tariq won the International Arbitration Junior of the Year award at the Legal 500 Awards (the award is based on input from law firms and the bar). His practice encompasses international arbitration public international law and general commercial litigation. He has represented or advised private parties and states under all the major arbitral rules including the ICC, LCIA, SCC, ICSID, UNCITRAL and DIAC rules, in a range of sectors including construction, oil and gas, mining, banking, insurance and reinsurance and telecommunications and energy. His experience includes acting for some of the world's largest companies in high value complex arbitrations involving disputes around the world. He also sits as an arbitrator and has been appointed by the LCIA and ICC to do so in a number of disputes. In 2012 he was nominated to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators. He has extensive experience of litigating disputes in the Middle East, having worked there for a number of years. He is also adept at dealing with political cases involving states and state owned entities. Prior to entering practice, he was a full time academic and had been a lecturer and tutor at the University of Oxford and assistant professor at the London School of Economics. He regularly writes and speaks on international arbitration, international law, and law of obligations including at the Harvard Law School and the British Institute for International and Comparative Law. His book Unjust Enrichment and Contract (Hart, Oxford, 2009) is cited in leading English texts, including Chitty on Contracts and Goff and Jones: The law of Unjust Enrichment, and was described by the professor of English law at Oxford as the "definitive" work in the area.
