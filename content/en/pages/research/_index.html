        <p>Research in law, and in particular criteria for excellence in research, have over the last decades globally shifted from a service towards legal practice to a purpose in itself, seeking the advancement of knowledge and understanding. CIDS in part follows this trend but, aware of the importance of continued critical contributions by academia to the defence and development of pacific methods of dispute settlement, it also significantly engages in service to practice.<br></p>
